      <p id="home-text-1">
        Athletes from Germany have taken part in most of the modern Olympic
        Games held since 1896. Germany has hosted three Olympic Games, in 1936
        both the Winter and Summer Games, and the 1972 Summer Olympics. In
        addition, Germany had been selected to host the 1916 Summer Olympics as
        well as the 1940 Winter Olympics, both of which had to be cancelled due
        to World Wars. After these wars, Germany was banned from participating
        in the 1920, 1924 and 1948 Olympics.
      </p>
      <div class="text-content">
        <p id="home-text-2">
          While the country was divided, each of the two German states boycotted
          one of the Summer Games. In 1980, West Germany was one of 66 nations
          which did not go to Moscow in protest at the Soviet Union's invasion
          of Afghanistan, and in 1984 East Germany joined the Soviet Union and
          several others in the boycott of the Summer Games in Los Angeles. In
          1990, East Germany and West Germany would reunite, with Germany once
          again competing as a single full sovereign state since the 1992
          Olympic year.
        </p>
        <p id="home-text-3">
          The IOC currently splits German results among four codes, even though
          only the German Democratic Republic (GDR) from 1968 to 1988 had sent a
          separate team to compete against the team of the German NOC that
          represented Germany (GER) since 1896.
